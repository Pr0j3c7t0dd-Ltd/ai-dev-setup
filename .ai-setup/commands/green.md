Now lets do step 2. GREEN: Minimal code to pass

Writing Minimal Code:
Now write the absolute minimum code needed to make this test pass. Nothing more, nothing less.
Make this test pass with the simplest possible implementation. Don't worry about edge cases or future features yet.

Catching Over-Engineering:
Is this the minimum code needed, or are you implementing extra features not covered by the current test?
Review your implementation: What parts aren't required by the failing test? Remove everything unnecessary.

After writing the code, please execute the tests
